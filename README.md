# ZeroDivisionError in Python Average Calculation
This example demonstrates a common error in Python when calculating the average of a list of numbers: a `ZeroDivisionError` that occurs when the list is empty. 
The provided `calculate_average` function does not handle the case of an empty input list. 
The solution involves adding a check for an empty list before performing the calculation.
